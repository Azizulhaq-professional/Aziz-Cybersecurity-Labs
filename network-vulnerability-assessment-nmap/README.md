# 📄 Network Vulnerability Assessment Using Nmap ##
📌 Overview This project demonstrates how to perform a basic vulnerability assessment using **Nmap** on a test machine (**Metasploitable2**) in a controlled lab environment. It showcases my ability to identify open ports, detect services, analyze risks, and recommend mitigations — a foundational skill for cybersecurity roles.
---
## 🛠️ Tools Used - Kali Linux (attacker machine) - Nmap (network scanning tool) - VirtualBox / VMware (virtualization platform) - Metasploitable2 (target VM)
---
## 🔎 Methodology
1. **Setup Environment** - Both VMs configured with Host-Only Adapter networking. - Target IP identified using `ifconfig`. 2. **Run Nmap Scans** - Basic scan: `nmap <target_ip>` - Service detection: `nmap -sV <target_ip>` - Vulnerability scripts: `nmap --script vuln <target_ip>` - Save results: `nmap -sV <target_ip> -oN nmap_results.txt` 3. **Analyze Results** - Identify risks (FTP anonymous login, SSH brute force, HTTP web attack surface, etc.). - Document findings in `report.pdf`.

## 📊 Key Findings | Port | Service | Risk | |------|---------|------| | 21 | FTP | Anonymous login; cleartext credentials. | | 22 | SSH | Brute force risk. | | 23 | Telnet | Insecure cleartext authentication. | | 80 | HTTP | Web attack surface (SQLi, XSS). | | 3306 | MySQL | Default credentials. |
---
## ✅ Recommendations - Disable unused services (Telnet, anonymous FTP). - Use firewalls to restrict access. - Patch outdated software. - Enforce strong authentication. - Replace insecure protocols with secure alternatives. - Harden web server configurations.

## 📁 Files Included - `report.pdf` — Full analysis and recommendations - `nmap_results.txt` — Raw scan output - `screenshots/` — Visual evidence of setup and findings

## ⚠️ Disclaimer This lab was conducted in a **controlled environment** using intentionally vulnerable systems. **Do not scan unauthorized systems.**
