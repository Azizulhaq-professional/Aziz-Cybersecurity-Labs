# 🛡️ Network Vulnerability Assessment Using Nmap

## 📌 Overview
This project demonstrates a basic vulnerability assessment using **Nmap** on a test machine (**Metasploitable2**) in a controlled lab environment. It showcases my ability to identify open ports, detect services, analyze risks, and recommend mitigations — foundational skills for cybersecurity roles.

## 🛠️ Tools Used
- **Kali Linux** – Attacker machine  
- **Metasploitable2** – Target VM  
- **Nmap** – Network scanning tool  
- **VirtualBox / VMware** – Virtualization platform

---

## 📋 Methodology

1. **Environment Setup**
   - Configured both VMs with Host-Only Adapter networking.
   - Identified target IP using `ifconfig`.

2. **Nmap Scanning**
   - Basic scan: `nmap <target_ip>`

   - Service detection: `nmap -sV <target_ip>`

   - Vulnerability scan: `nmap --script vuln <target_ip>`

3. **Result Analysis**
   - Identified risks such as FTP anonymous login, SSH brute force, and HTTP vulnerabilities.
   - Documented findings in `report.pdf`.

## 📊 Key Findings

| Port | Service | Risk |
|------|---------|------|
| 21   | FTP     | Anonymous login; cleartext credentials |
| 22   | SSH     | Brute force risk |
| 23   | Telnet  | Insecure cleartext authentication |
| 80   | HTTP    | Web attack surface (SQLi, XSS) |
| 3306 | MySQL   | Default credentials |

---

## ✅ Recommendations
- Disable unused services (Telnet, anonymous FTP)
- Use firewalls to restrict access
- Patch outdated software
- Enforce strong authentication
- Replace insecure protocols with secure alternatives
- Harden web server configurations
